Description

The developed control shows the impacts in a range of time vs the allowed limit.
Where we will have to, if an impact exceeds the allowed limit this will represent as a critical impact.
In addition we will have 2 boxes of texts that will contain information on the number of impacts and the number of critical impacts that exist in the specified time range
For our use case the control could be used in a mill.

Requeriments

Two attributes are needed, the first attribute represents the impacts of the equipment and
the second attribute represents the limit or objective of the impacts

Instructions

Select the control "countLimit", then select the attribute of impacts that is required to visualize and drag where it is required to visualize the graph, and we will notice that a graph with nothing or incomplete will be created. To finish and the graph is shown we will make a final step.
Select the limit or objective attribute and drag over the incomplete control that was created, so that with this last attribute, our control will be graphed.
